# Cat Energy - Cat's Food Shop

Study project that I've made a long time ago.
Recently I decided to revisit it and make a list of improvements.
In the process I learn a bit of different stuff like 11ty, Nunjucks, Leaflet, etc.

Here's the summary of what I've done so far:
- Added pages:
  - index page
  - 🗃️ catalog
  - 📋 form page
  - 📰 blog
- Running on 11ty with templating via Nunjucks
- Hosted on Netlify
- Content managment via Netlify CMS

Plan to make:
- Add new pages:
  - ℹ️ about
  - 🛒 cart
  - 💳 checkout
  - 🛍️ product
  - 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏻 team
- Deliver images via CDN
- Add pagination for catalog
- Add comments section
- Add feedback form
- Design packages for new flavours
- Design basic dark theme
- Make site bilingual
