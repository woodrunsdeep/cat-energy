# Cat Energy - Cat's Food Shop

Study project that I've made a long time ago.
Recently I decided to revisit it and make a list of improvements.
In the process I learn a bit of different stuff like 11ty, Nunjucks, Leaflet, etc.

Here's the summary of what I've done so far:
- Added pages:
    - 📰 blog
    - 🗃️ catalog
    - 📋 form page
- Running on 11ty with templating via Nunjucks
- Hosted on Netlify 
- Content managment via Netlify CMS

Plan to make:
- Add new pages
    - ℹ️ about
    - 🛒 cart
    - 💳 checkout
    - 🛍️ product
    - 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏻 team
- Deliver images via Cloudinary
- Add pagination for catalog
- Design packages for new flavours
- Add comments section
- Add feedback form
- Design basic dark theme
- Made site bilingual
